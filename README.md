# FlappyBird4Delphi
Flappy Bird Clone in Delphi üöÄ

A fun and lightweight clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using Delphi and FireMonkey (FMX). 
This project demonstrates the power of Delphi for creating cross-platform 2D games with smooth animations and responsive gameplay.




**Features** üïπÔ∏è




**Simple Controls**: Press the spacebar to make the bird "flap" and avoid the pipes.

**Dynamic Obstacles**: Procedurally generated pipes with animations.

**Responsive Gameplay**: Smooth animations using TFloatAnimation for movement.

**Cross-Platform**: Built with FMX, supporting Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

**Customizable Code**: Easily tweak game parameters like speed, gravity, and pipe spacing.




**Technical Highlights** üõ†Ô∏è



Uses FireMonkey's animation framework (TFloatAnimation) for seamless object movement.

Implements keyboard events for interactive gameplay.

Demonstrates object-oriented programming in Delphi for game logic.

Clear, modular code that serves as a great learning resource for Delphi developers.




**How to Run** üíª




Clone the repository: git clone **https://github.com/fernandoleitebarreto/FlappyBird4Delphi.git**
